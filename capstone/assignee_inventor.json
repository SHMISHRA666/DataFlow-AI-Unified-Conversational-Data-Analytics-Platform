    "patent_abstract":"Method and system for predicting an oil temperature of a transformer for a desired load and\/or predicting a load that a transformer can support for a desired time. A machine learning algorithm is developed using historical data of a transformer. After the algorithm is developed, historical data corresponding to the transformer are input into the algorithm to develop a profile of the transformer describing how the temperature of oil within the transformer is expected to change as a function of a desired load. Using the profile, the of temperature of the transformer is predicted for a desired load. In this way, a prediction is made as to whether and\/or for how long a transformer may support a desired load before the oil temperature reaches a specified threshold and\/or before the transformer fails due to the load.",

    "patent_abstract":"Data on agricultural machines can be outputted to mobile terminals easily and properly. A data collection device is provided separately from a control device that controls the operation of an agricultural machine and is connected to a vehicle communication network installed in the agricultural machine, and is removably connected to the vehicle communication network. The data collection device includes a data collection unit for collecting agricultural machine data outputted to the vehicle communication network, an authorization determination unit for implementing authentication with a mobile terminal to determine whether or not the collected data is transmitted to the mobile terminal by wireless communication, and a data communication unit for transmitting data to the mobile terminal by wireless communication when the authorization determination unit authorizes data transmission.",

A method includes, for each mobile user in the set, obtaining at least one location context category therefor from publically available information responsive to uncertain mobile device location data. The method further includes applying multi-user collaborative machine learning to the at least one location context category for each mobile user in the set to infer a single refined location context category for each mobile user in the set.",

    "patent_abstract":"An MR code is generated within a browser on a client device and is read by a mobile application on a mobile device. A communication channel is then established through a web-based service, between the browser and the mobile application on the mobile device. The mobile application generates a user interface display on the mobile device that allows user selection of content. The mobile application sends a link to that content to the browser, which accesses and renders the content on the client device. User input commands to control the rendered content are also received at the mobile device and sent to the browser through the communication channel.",
